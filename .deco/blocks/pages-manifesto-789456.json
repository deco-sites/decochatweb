      "content": "<p>Software should serve ambition, not stall it. Yet building AI‑powered tools still feels gated by DevOps rituals, fragmented stacks and opaque costs. Businesses cross the 100‑person mark and hit a wall of backlog and bottlenecks. Non‑technical doers wait in ticket queues; developers fight YAML. It's 2025—this is theft of human momentum.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone should be able to declare work and watch software materialise, safe, observable and affordable. We believe the next era is not <em>low‑code</em>; it's actually <strong>vibecoding</strong>—expressing intent in plain language while trusted agents wire the rest.</p>\n\n<p>Deco is the open‑source operating system for autonomous companies. We mesh every tool, model and dataset into secure, observable MCPs, then let builders compose <strong>Agents, Workflows & Views</strong> in chat—no code, no ops. One click spins up logs, billing and guardrails; one line drops into code when you want to go wild.</p>",
